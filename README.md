# MOBILE-PRICE-PREDICTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-TECHNIQUES

**ðŸ“±Content:** 

The price of a cell phone, which has become a necessity in our daily lives, varies widely depending on its specifications. In this notebook, we will explore the factors that affect cell phone prices and predict new samples based on the best model.

**ðŸ“±This notebook includes the following:**

- Preprocessing
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Preparing the data to train a model
- Training and making predictions using various classification models
- Model evaluation
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Result
- Model Deployment
    
**ðŸ“±Objective:**   
    
Our objective is to predict the price range of a mobile phone by building a model that takes into account various features provided in the dataset. We will be using supervised learning methods such as **LINEAR REGRESSION****Decision Trees (DTs)**, **Random Forest**, and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**,**GRADIENT BOOSTING** to determine the best model for this problem.

**ðŸ“±What Problem We Have?**
    
Our task is to perform a classification on the target variable "Price Range" based on the data and attribute information. To achieve the best possible classification, we will develop a model that accurately predicts the price range of mobile phones.

## Dataset ðŸ“”

[Kaggle link: Mobile Price Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification?select=train.csv)

**ðŸ“”About Dataset**

The dataset consists of various attributes related to mobile phones, such as battery power, Bluetooth capability, processor speed, and camera specifications. The target variable, "Price Range," classifies phones into four categories: Low Cost, Medium Cost, High Cost, and Very High Cost. Our task is to build a classification model to accurately predict the price range based on these features.

**ðŸ“”Problem Statement:**
Our task is to perform a classification on the target variable "Price Range" based on the data and attribute information. To achieve the best possible classification, we will develop a model that accurately predicts the price range of mobile phones.
